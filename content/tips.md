# Important tips


1. Do not leave a question, partial marks will be given for partial completion.

2. Focus on the high % tasks first.

3. If you have stuck with a problem, flag that and move onto next one.

4. Restart your laptop a day before the exam. ( I didn't restart mine for a month and slowed down during the last 40 minutes of exam)

5. Imperative commands are your oxygen. practice ! practice ! practice !

6. Bookmark the k8s documentation pages
